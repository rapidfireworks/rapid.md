- # Kotlin Coroutines
- launch
	- coroutine builder
- delay
	- suspends the coroutine for a specific time
- runBlocking
	- coroutine builder that bridges the non-coroutine world of a regular fun and the code with coroutines inside
	- the thread that runs it gets blocked for the duration of the call, until all the coroutines inside runBlocking complete their execution
- ## Structured Concurrency
- new coroutines can be only launched in a specific CoroutineScope which delimits the lifetime of the coroutine
- ## Scope Builder
- runBlocking
	- blocks the current thread for waiting
- coroutineScope
- ## Cancellation and timeouts
- Coroutine cancellation is cooperative.
- NonCancellable
- withTimeout
- ## Concurrent using async
- launch
	- returns a Job and does not carry any resulting value
- async
	- returns a Deferred — a light-weight non-blocking future that represents a promise to provide a result later
