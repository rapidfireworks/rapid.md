- [[Remote Sensing]] 시 [[Spatial Resolution]], [[Spectral Resolution]], [[Temporal Resolution]] 사이에는 하나의 해상도를 높이려면 나머지 두 해상도를 낮추어야하는 식의 트레이드 오프가 존재한다.
- # Introduction to Remote Sensing
- ## Remote Sensing
- Remote sensing is the science of identifying, observing, collecting and measuring objects without coming into direct contact with them.
- ## Passive Sensor
- Passive sensors record the natural energy that is (naturally) reflected or emitted from the Earth's surface (e.g. sunlight, moonlight, city lights).
- ## Active Sensor
- Active sensors provide their own energy source for illumination (e.g. RADAR, LIDAR).
- ## Spatial Resolution
- Spatial resolution signifies the ground surface area that forms one pixel in the image. Sub-pixel objects can sometimes be resolved.
- 공간 해상도
- ## Spectral Resolution
- Spectral resolution signifies the number and width of spectral bands of the sensor. The higher the spectral resolution, the narrower the wavelength range for a given channel or band.
- 스펙트럼 분해능
- ## Temporal Resolution
- Temporal resolution refers to the repeat cycle, or frequency, with which a sensor revisits the same part of the Earth’s surface. You might hear this referred to as a satellite’s “revisit time.”
- 시간 분해능
- ## Advantages of using remotely sensed data for economic studies
- Improved accessibility to information difficult to obtain by other means
- High(er) spatial resolution
- Wide geographic coverage and high temporal resolution
